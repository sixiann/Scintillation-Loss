# Scintillation-Loss

These scripts model the atmospheric scintillation loss for the uplink, downlink and scientific beacons of a satellite, based on [Larry C Andrews' Laser Beam Scintillation with Applications](https://books.google.com/books/about/Laser_Beam_Scintillation_with_Applicatio.html?id=bSFRAAAAMAAJ).
These statistics are included in the design of the link budget and quantum payload of [Spooqy's Cubesat project](https://speqtral.space/entanglement-in-orbit-demonstrated-with-spooqy-1-cubesat/), which aims to demonstrate space-to-ground quantum key distribution.
